* Mobile: ![Alt text](assets/images/mobile.jpg?raw=true "Entrance")

* Create the container, header and page content sections of the page

* Create even margins for the header and page content sections

* Create the nav bar with flex-box

* Create images and bio section with flex-box

* Add styling to emulate the spec

* Create @media breakpoints to create a responsive look for different size screens
